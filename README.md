# coin
A stub repo for a Go-based cryptocurrency miner, wallet, and storage system implemented for CS1951L.

The architecture of the project is heavily inspired by Bitcoin's original whitepaper. Makes heavy use of gRPC calls and protobufs for server-to-server communication. 

For a more detailed overview, read the handout for the [first](https://hackmd.io/@cs1951l-2023/chain) and [second](https://hackmd.io/@cs1951l-2023/coin) half of the project.
